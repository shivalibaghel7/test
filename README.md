Let's build a frontend application using reactjs.

This is a bike rental application, which should have the following features.

-- SignIn and SignUp pages. User should register before login. Once he's registered he should be taken to login page.

-- After login he'll be taken to home page where, there is a search filter. He can search the bikes based on start and end dates.

-- When the user clicks on the book button at a particular bike, he should be taken to checkout page.

-- Checkout page should have all the details of the bike selected. Here user can confirm his booking by clicking the confirm booking button or he can go back using go back button.

-- If he confirms his booking, the bike will be added to myBooking page. Here he can unbook his bike.

-- NavBar is present in all the pages other than SignIn and SignUp pages.

-- When user clicks Logout on NavBar he should be taken to SignIn page.

-- Use a datepicker component to build a search filter.

-- Use components like NavBar component, Card component.

-- Use react routing for navigation between the pages.

-- You can use bootstrap, css, reactstrap for styling.
